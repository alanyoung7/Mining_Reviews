Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,Works quite well.  Bu thas the potential to be something quite phenomenal as it develops further
MyFortress,The only features are verbal commands. Cannot link the central station to the Alexa app. Very time consuming and pointless to use arm/ disarm the system thru Alexa. Use the MyFortress app instead.
Stock Price,"“Sorry, I’m having trouble accessing your Stock Price skill right now.”"
Ally,"I just got started with the scale, thanking “wow this will be an easy way to transfer funds between my savings and checking accounts!”."

Veteran Transition Tips,"What better way to learn about transition out of the military than from someone who has been there, done that, and probably still has a bunch of the T-shirts? Great way to get tips to have the post-military life that all service members desire and deserve."
Capital One,Works perfect.
Account Access,Alexa devices would not give me my balance keep giving me the  Definition for balance
Numerica,It’s awesome to be able to bank hands free while I wash the dishes.
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,"I really enjoy the app, I was on the waitlist for a while back in '17. When I first got the app I loved it, then no idea why but for months it wouldn't work. Tried to use skill again recently and is working as well as it did before. This app makes Alexa so much more useful for me, being able to get and send texts hands free. It's a little weird sometimes about understanding some names, some texts end up reading like auto correct fails, and only works in almost complete silence, but I still like it"
Thirty Second Money Tip with Nick True,Entertaining and good tips that make sense and are easy to apply
Capital One,I enjoy how easy it's to use
Prudential Retirement,"I use this skill and it’s great.
Great way to get the info I need fast."
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,It's easy to set up and use.
Capital One,"If this app had a better interface and allowed you to make multiple payments (not just when your statement is due), I would give the app a 5/5. The app won’t let you make a second Payment in a month even if you still have an account balance."
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,Find my phone app is great

Ten Things in Tech,good update on tech news...matches traditional e-sources
Donnie Keller - Fort Worth Real Estate,"He has lots of patience, and knowledgeable about everything. He gives the best advice on how and what to do when it comes to houses."
Mike Hrezo - Valencia Real Estate,"We were referred to Mike Hrezo by a realtor in another community. It proved to be an excellent referral.  Not only is he extremely skilled, knowledgeable and personable, but he truly cares about delivering all-around service excellence.
Because of him, the transaction was smooth, speedy and effortless.

In fact, we were so impressed that we sought Mike's assistance to complete another real estate transaction several years later. Though we were expecting great things, he still managed to wow us.  You may be sure that, should we ever have the opportunity to do another real estate transaction in the Santa Clarita area, Mike will be our first and only call."
A Moment for Success,Nice idea but nothing revolutionary. Deep breaths and fresh outdoor air was all I got and it started repeating. Was expecting things I didn’t already know.
Cloud.in Flash briefings,
The Motley Fool,"Ridiculously bad. Voice recognition is accurate, but app can't match the accurate company name with the company. Needs a manual entry option or needs to work with ticker symbols. Until then, it's a frustrating waste of time."
Bolivar Today,no funciona
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,This app works great.  Finally an app that works well with Alexa.
TradeIt,Tried 3 quotes didn't support any of them. So I disabled.
Thirty Second Money Tip with Nick True,"Great program, and truly down to earth.
*** you asked for ideas so; Making people aware of the fact that plastic is REAL money, and you have to pay it back at a premium dependant on the interest they charge. That TV that you bought for $500 because it was on sale will cost you $700 if you make minimum payments. Regular price for the same TV is $600."
Run To Your Leadership Challenges!,"Paul has some fantastic tools to apply in a practical way. I’m loving this briefing because it keeps me focused on being a better leader for the people in my life. Thanks, Paul!"
My Home Value,This app is worthless. Can't recognize my address. Is it me or does Alexa have an attitude?
Princeton Partners Marketing Insights,I like that it is weekly and provides a short insight into what's happening in Marketing today.  Very relevant.
Thirty Second Money Tip with Nick True,"The information is clear and helpful. As with most things, its easy to begin managing your money with the best plan/intentions, only to easily get bogged down or distracted. Nick's info helps you stay on track, remember what's important, and what the long term goal is so you don't get overwhelmed in day to day. Worth subscribing!"
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,without the companion app the skill is pointless
Amex,the convenience of this skill has me using the card for more purchases. fast and hands free for any info or to pay the bill. very cool
User10,

Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,I was wowed by the app in use with Amazon's echo dot. The only thing that disappointed me was that I couldn't read my emails thru your app in use with Alexa. But that's nitpicking really. It's great.
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,Maybe the best Alexa skill yet!
Cryptocurrency Flash Briefing,
Online Business Publicity Tips,
Make Me Smart,When playing in this scheme  some features will not work. Volume control will now lower.  Alexa continue to repeat her own  commands until I had yell stop.
The Motley Fool,"I can't find my watch list on the mobile app, after Alexa added a bunch of random stocks while trying to delete one it added. When asking for my watch list stock prices it just gives the biggest mover only then says check the app which I can't find on it"
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,"Hi

Star One,
Fidelity Investments,"This is one area where Siri is superior. Siri has had this capability since inception on IOS. ""Siri how's the market doing today?"" Brings an interview intelligent response as does a request for individual tickets."
Capital One,"After I got an email to relink my account for new features, I keep getting an error that there is an issue with my capitol one account.
There is no issue and the bank cannot help. Amazon has opened a ticket but still not working. Next time check an update before you email people. If its not working soon I will be calling our local consumer reporter. Zero Stars does not work so had to give One Star."
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,since this is a beta version it does have some bugs. but the more you play with it the easier it is to use. Having it on my wife's and my phone seems to conflict. It can't differentiate the two phones.
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,"The application is a fantasic pair with Alexa. Puts access to everything I use on my phone on a voice activated hands free device. This includes reading incoming text messages, integrating with my work and private email services, as well multiple calendars. Love that I can ask who's calling when my phone is in one room and I'm in another and get messages via text just as easily. Huge time saver and no fumbling to unlock my phone or locate it to access it."
Prudential Retirement,"Downloaded the app only to discover it requires yet another access code, this one being 6 digits!  Not only that, you have to verbalize it every time so, Alexa and anyone around can hear it!  So much for convenience."
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,so far it works great.

Southwest Florida Real Estate,
Front Row Entrepreneur,I need to stay up to date on the ever changing social media scene for my biz. Jen’s short and to the point style fits perfectly into my time-strapped day. Thanks Jen - don’t know what I’d do without you!
Store Card,Says I have to link my account but wont let me enter a 4 digit pin number.
Store Card,"The card is definitely convenient and a great thing to have for online orders. But amazon can literally not help you with anything. If you ask them for any help you’ll automatically be given the response contact synchrony bank. So just be prepared that if you have any issues, want to make a payment or what have you, you cannot do it through amazon. They will not help you."
Run To Your Leadership Challenges!,This is a great podcast for team leaders in mid to high level leadership.
Amex,"This skill works as advertised and is very easy to use and set up. However, it is actually much faster to just use the AMEX app on your phone. The number of prompts from Alexa required to accomplish anything really slows the process down. You can only make a payment when a payment is actually due. i.e. you can't pay before the due date. Not a big deal, but it's not the way I manage my account. I'll probably stick with the AMEX iPhone App instead of this skill."
CryptoTracker,"Whenever you ask for a price in bitcoin of any ALT, the answer usually involves several decimal places, this app only supports 1 decimal place, so pretty useless.  Try it out.  Ask it, What is the price of Ripple in Bitcoin?"
Thirty Second Money Tip with Nick True,"Don't have time for a podcast? Sometimes you just need a quick piece of advice to supercharge your day. Nick's tips are relevant, motivating, and fun! I know where I'll be turning when I need a quick piece of advice!"

Capital One,Wow!!  I love this skill application!  😀👍
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,"Why would I want to use Alexa to text message if I have to tap the phone to send? The whole point is to be hands-free! If it doesn't work with Apple just say it doesn't, don't make it sort of work."
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,Not working. Couldn't connect with my contacts.
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,It makes you almost dependent of alexa.

The last chapter said it all: ""a tactic know, is no tactic at all.""  Glad I took the time to listen to it, and I'll be using it over and over again."

She is talented, smart, and extremely motivated. Her bubbly and caring personality makes her a go getter, as she always has her clients best interest at heart. Vanessa is someone I highly recommend."
Comcast Business,
SSML Editor,"SSML is a markup language providing enough tools to make voice from text sound real. Yet, memorizing and coding all the tags is typically very time consuming. This editor makes it much easier. I was able to start and finish converting my six paragraph project from text to perfect speech on the day I first learned SSML existed. The editor can make Alexa speak the result, or the finished markup text can be pasted into any SSML player, such as Amazon Polly."
One Minute Retirement Tip with Ashley,The one minute retirement tip with Ashley is how I start my day. I immediately feel like my day if off to a great informed start. Ashley is very knowledgeable.  Thanks Amazon
Sowing Seed Flash Briefing,This briefing gives you some great info about a variety of areas of your life. Great points to ponder!
Harvard Business Review: Management Tip,"I wouldnt ordinarily bother to write a review, but this podcast is so poor, idealistic, and uninsightful to actual challenges in the workplace, its irritating to listen to. It sounds like it comes from someone who hasnt been actually challenged nor been employed in a competitive environment. I would expect more from HBR"

"Chadwick DeVries - Prescott, Arizona Real Estate","When we decided to move to Prescott, Chad reached out to us about Talking Rock Ranch.  Chad is extremely knowledgeable and professional.  We relied on Chad since we lived out of state and he was always available for us when we traveled to Prescott.  After looking at many options, we decided on a home under construction.  Chad did not disappear after the sale and represented us throughout the process.  I would use Chad again in a heartbeat and highly recommend him for Prescott real estate needs."
Create My Voice,"Great concept-
Great fuctionality"
YNAB,Works great

Front Row Entrepreneur,"Whatever platform you're on, Jennifer's got information for you! This is the Flash Briefing you need to listen to for the latest updates on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn and more. There is no way I could track all of the updates on all of the platforms, and I love that Jennifer takes care of that for me. She'll even let you know tips and trends you can use in your social media messages to make them timely and relevant. I've got it on my ""Start my day"" Alexa routine so that I never miss an update."
Live Love Lex Minute,
TIAA,"I love this app, it's so easy to check stock quotes and market performance.  Trying to go screen free for the first and last 30 minutes of the day, no one said I can't use Alexa!"
Bloomberg,not worth since i bot the echo show for bloomberg tv only and now its not there .....
Business Leadership Series,This Flash Briefing gives you some great tips you can utilize immediately.
BECU,"This is a great v1 release. From a user perspective, it is important to consider what is the fastest, easiest way to get info. Asking for a balance is a good example. Listing 30 transactions is much better suited to a visual interface. One of the key use cases that would make this a killer app for me is to be able to quickly ask ""who did check number 5678 go to?"". It takes a long time to log into the BECU website, go to checking, set up the correct date range for the query, find and click on the check number I want, and then get the pop up that shows who the check was written to. Instead, I'd like to be able to ask Alexa and get the info immediately. This may be tougher if you have to do OCR on the check image before returning the result, but if that is too hard then you can text the image to my phone. Want to discuss further? look up my member info and give me a call or email.  -Dana Young."
Fidelity Investments,Doesn't recognize or can't find basic stocks. Probably not an issue with fidelity... but more so with alexa not understanding.
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,Useful app if your phone us lost!!
Innovation Update,A great daily hit of what's new in the field of innovation.
Store Card,"Terrible app. After linking accounts, you create a 4-digit voice key. After using the skill to request something, you are asked for your voice key... over and over and over again. It simply won't recognize your key despite setting it up repeatedly."
Bloomberg,Tom Keene
Gary Vee Quote of the Day,

Morningstar,"alexa simply does not respond  to morningstar anymore, it doesn't work....it worked until i added a number of other skills, then it went dead, kind of useless anyway, i couldn't access price quotes or my premium subscription for information"
Front Row Entrepreneur,"Jen's flash briefing is super helpful. I count on her daily (how do she do that?) briefing to keep me up to date with the changes and trends in social. I appreciate that she doesn't just share what's new she also provides context. Why is it important? How can I use it? What will it mean to my clients?
That is incredibly valuable and Jen's giving it away every day!
This briefing is going to help you filter what you need to know - and how to take advantage or make changes to your social media efforts for best results."
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,"Installed Mastermind app on the phone.
Need to evaluate Memory/Storage usage etc.

MAUI LIVING: Real Estate & Lifestyle Insights,
Cheddar,The most irritating part of this otherwise great business news summary is the extremely crappy background music they play that drowns out their message. What a waste.
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,"Very cool... we need more of this type of control over these important matters in our lives,!"
Currency Converter,Does not work as advertised. I asked it several times how much a pound was worth in USD using the examples as a script and it would not give me an answer. It told me several times that 1 USD is worth 1 USD. It also would only list the names of currencies it claimed to know several times without any exchange rates.
TD Ameritrade,"Need account access and watch list, otherwise nothing special."
Crypto Junky,
Marx Trader,"Very useful for keeping track of cryptos. Very accurate, reliable, easy to use."

Faith Harmer - Las Vegas NV Real Estate,"I have bought and sold homes with Faith over the past 6 years. In my opinion, there is no other real estate agent in Las Vegas. I have referred her to numerous friends an family members over the years and they all say the same.

Faith is extremely competent and a true professional. She is an amazing communicator and you will never feel like you are out of the loop. Fath makes buying and selling a breeze and has your best interest in mind.  Do yourself a favor and put Faith in your corner!"
Fidelity Investments,"Should give you a portfolio summary (including movers, YTD return).  Too verbose for the limited info it provides..."

Make Me Smart,"This is a great skill. You get a fun explanation about a different subject each day. The info is interesting and I've learned a lot already. It would be nice if there were any option at the end to say you're done with the skill. Currently, Alexa asks if I would like to repeat the explainer, but if I don't, I just have to wait for her to ask me twice and then the skill shuts off."

Thirty Second Money Tip with Nick True,"Really Enjoy these Daily Money Tips on Common Sense Ways for Saving Money.  The examples and personal references are very helpful.

The recent Daily Money Tip on ""Options"" was a ""Home Run"" for Me.  I personally live for having ""Options"" my whole life.

The only ""Options"" most people have these days is too make enough money to feed and house themselves ""One Day At A Time"".

Saving Money is ""Not Just About Having Money"" to ""Buy Useless Stuff"" but is about the ""Options"" it affords you.  Like being able to quit a ""Bad Job"" with plenty of money saved to keep you afloat until you find a more suitable job or getting into a better savings or investment that requires Higher ""Initial"" Investment for the ""Better Rates"".

Having ""Options"" just makes life ""Less Stressful"" not having to worry about an emergency right around the corner and not having enough money saved when car breaks down or medical emergency.

Having ""Options"" provides room to move and make choices when otherwise you would be pushed into a corner with ""No Choices"".  Was that ""Starbucks"" Coffee, Overpriced New Car or Cheap Stapled Furniture Really Worth It when it meant going hungry later after being laid off from your job.

Sure I miss out buying the Newest TV Technology or Streaming Service but you cannot feed or house yourself with those things.  Besides there is more to see and experience ""First Hand"" outside in the ""Real World"" that is not on the Television or Mobile Device.

Expensive Shoes, Clothes, Technology, Coffee and Monthly Services might provide some ""Short Term"" entertainment but has a major impact on your finances and severely limits your ""Options"" when money is needed later on for retirement or emergency.

Great Job Nick.  Know It, Learn It, Live It."

Thirty Second Money Tip with Nick True,"Clear, concise, and insightful. What more can you ask for in a quick-tip financial podcast?!"
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,"Giving it 5 for potential. Absolutely tremendous help for those with limited mobility. Send and receive texts, check notifications, chromecast, check diary, and much more, just by asking Alexa/Echo to 'Ask Mastermind...' The biggest hurdle at the moment is Alexa's weak voice recognition and AI skills, but the developers can't be blamed for that. A great step forward for voice control and will be an essential add-on (unless Amazon buy them out!)"
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,"Way cool, gives Echo Dot features that I wanted since day one.😎 The casting needs to be two commands, one to mirror display, and one to show the notifactions stream..."
Front Row Entrepreneur,"I think the information is good, however she only updates her information weekly, which means if you use your flash briefing to start your day, it’s very annoying to hear the same information and recording for multiple days. Last week she said something incorrectly, and she caught her mistake which was good, but she caught it in the middle of her recording. With her only updating once a week I got to hear her stumble through the mistake each morning, I just wanted to stop my entire flash briefing because hers are so long. If she broke up her information she’d have enough content for a few days. Finally, she gives a plug for classes, she might be great with sharing content but I would not buy into taking a class from her for flash briefings given what I’ve observed so far. I think she has a lot of potential. I’ve not deleted her flash briefing, just moved it to the end so I can be out the door by the time she begins in case it’s the same information. I’ll keep listening for a few more weeks, with the hopes she gets better."
CNBC,if it worked I could review it
YAPI,As with many many Alexa apps it is just to much hazzle. Alexa has to get smarter and auto connect

Each day, Josh and others from the Ritholtz team share interesting stories from the past about the market, major company moves, pivotal moments in business, important births and deaths, and more from this day in history. Then you hear about what ultimately happened and where things stand today.

Best of all - there's no fluff and it's under three minutes. Easily my favorite finance or history / educational briefing."

CNBC,Love this in the flash briefing
Columbus Real Estate,"It sounds great, but it would not understand my voice spoken address no matter how many different ways I tried to say it.  During the linking process perhaps an option to automatically type in some data to get you started would have been helpful.  There probably is some account I can log into online (since I was forced to submit some details at the start) but I'm over it now and I'm moving on"
Thirty Second Money Tip with Nick True,Great insight!
Mike Hrezo - Valencia Real Estate,"When my wife and I decided to move to a single story home in the Valencia Mike Hrezo came to our aide.  We met with him and told him what we were looking for in a home.  We were not expecting to find a house meeting our requirements in a short time but within a month Mike found the exact house.  He worked with the seller to negotiate the price, the purchase of some of the fixtures, paintings and yard furniture.  He then moved forward with the purchase with very little work required by us.  He was very professional and knowledgeable of the process.  It was very painless for us.  I would recommend using Mike to anyone selling or buying a house."

Store Card,"It's a pretty neat app but I wanted to point out that the 4-digit security code you have to set up does not work as it should. If you use a ""zero"" in your code, it does not recognize you saying ""zero"" and you must use ""Oh"" as in the sound of the letter ""O"" in place of ""zero"".

Alexa, a zero is not the letter ""O""."

Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,"Unless I'm wrong, this app is pretty useless. Asking Alexa to send someone a message has this app send you a text of what you just said and then you hit send. Siri and Hey Google do the exact same thing without that last step. Don't waste your time."

The Pitch with Amy Summers,"I recently started tuning in to Amy's ""The Pitch"". I really appreciate how she is able to provide useful, actionable tips in quick sound bites. My favorite episode so far was the one recently about using a series of questions to pitch an idea/person/story that starts with gaining an understanding of what the other person wants and is looking for. Too many times, it's easy to fall into the trap of pitching without first understanding how what we're pitching is going to be relevant or needed by the other person. Amy helped make that more clear for me. Keep up the good work!"

She is unique because she practices what she preaches.  As a career creative and marketer, I derive with each episode something a can apply to my life and work.  Again, this may seem easy but it takes time to research and a deep knowledge of technology and marketing and communications to simplify it into layman’s terms.  I highly recommend listening each day - so you can be delighted while gaining insight to improve your marketing campaigns, and be up-to-date with current trends."

Crypto Manager,"This Skill is an excellent companion for anyone that is looking to track their Crypto Currency Portfolio. The Skill targets those that deal with Crypto Currency and a daily basis. I was able to easily add and edit amounts and update my portfolio with little to no issues. The Skill understood all of the different types of Crypto Currency that I could think of and provided a total amount of my portfolio when requested, based on real-time prices. The one drawback, there is no skill cards used in the Skill. Without it being linked to an official account their is no reason why a skill card could not display the current price of the currencies if asked or the total value of your portfolio. In addition, please update the Skill to all English Regions. Overall, I do believe that this is worth enabling if you need a crypto currency manager, 2 thumbs up."
The Pitch with Amy Summers,"Amy is an deeply experienced, erudite professional who distills her hard-earned lessons into a rich, daily briefing applicable to a wide variety of professionals. Dig through the archives, sign up for the daily briefing, and deepen your knowledge base. Go Gators!"
StockTrigger,"She said that she was a Nova still and needed to check with her master before she could find me the answer to which stock I was looking for, bummer"
Marketplace Morning Report,"It went from 10-15 minutes to 45-60. Why? I rarely hear Kai Ryssdal or David Brancaccio anymore, instead I hear what I assume are interns or inexperienced millenials based on their diction and poor interviewing skills. It sounds like something I would hear on MTV. Marketplace Morning Report used to be my favorite Alexa skill. I finally removed it today."
Globe Advisor,
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,Love it very much
Mike Hrezo - Valencia Real Estate,"Mike Herzo has represented us on several home purchases and sales over the last 20 years.  His honesty, professionalism and commitment to his clients is exemplary.

Faith Harmer - Las Vegas NV Real Estate,"I live in another state and needed to sell my mother’s home after she passed away.  Faith and her amazing team went above and beyond during every step of the process.

The most helpful part for me was when Faith and her team assisted in getting repairs and upgrades coordinated on my behalf so that the house would look nice when it was placed on the market.  Faith has an extensive list of preferred contractors that she recommends... and they are all fantastic. The finished product was a beautiful house with an up-to-date style that was highly desirable to buyers.  We had multiple offers, the house sold very quickly, and we got over the asking price!

Every time I think about Faith & Team, I smile because they worked so hard on my behalf to make sure I had a flawless experience from beginning to end.  Thank you so much!"
Fox Business,Gives a straight forward business related news update. This is not the Fox opinion cable channel nor is it MSNBC obviously.

Exponea,
My Home,Permissions button does no trespond on fire hd.
Bitcoin Info,"Works as advertised. my only complaint is that the invoke command feels cumbersome.  I'd prefer ""Alexa, what's the current bitcoin price?"", but i suppose that's the inherent evil in this functionality having to be packaged as a skill"
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,Seems to do just what it claims to do. That can be pretty rare with apps and skills.
check cryptomarket,Quickly enabled and got it up and running to get Alexa to be even more helpful!
Second Guess Social,"Love the insights. Quick, easy, and thought-provoking.. The only social media news brief I've seen so far."
Wake 'em Up Public Speaking with Tom Antion,"Any chance I get to sit in on a Tom Antion class, I do it. So glad to see him here on Alexa Skills. Antion isn't a theorist. He's done everything he teaches. His down-to-earth approach cuts through the bull and gets down to the nitty gritty of how to be effective and get paid."
Faith Harmer - Las Vegas NV Real Estate,"When my wife and I decided it was time to sell our home we were fortunate to find Faith Harmer.  We asked Faith to look at our home and suggest things we could or should do to best prepare the house to sell at a good price.

Faith shared her thoughts and we  took her advice.  When we asked if she knew people who could be trusted to do good work for us at a reasonable price she graciously provided a list of people she had used in the past.  Their work confirmed that they were people who did good work at a fair price.

When we felt the house was ready to be listed Faith arranged photographs and a video tour of the house.  Both were amazing.

In a market that was growing tougher for sellers we received a full price offer about three weeks from the date we listed.  We closed less than thirty days later for the full asking price.

Here is the amazing part of that:  The appraiser, hired by the buyer, appraised our home $20,000 lower than our asking price.  Faith believed that the appraisal was flawed and showed the buyer’s agent and appraiser how and why it was flawed.  The appraiser studied Faith’s argument and adjusted his appraisal up.  Amazing!  Faith knows her stuff.

Faith is the kind of agent that you want on your side when you are ready to sell your home.  We were really fortunate to find her."
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,"Working good. I use it to find my phone daily. Good job guys.

Mitch Jackson's Trial Lawyer Communication Tips,
Albany Real Estate,Cool! Newest tech searching for my home. Easy to use. Kept checking back to hear updates.
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,"Did not work at all as advertised or demonstrated in the Video. Here are some examples: ""There are no items in your reading list"" is the response to over ten commands tried. Not sure what calendar the app is referring to as it reports there are no events, however in the linked calendar there are multiple events and dates. Would not do anything related to calls (when asked to make a call it replied that there's nothing in the reading list). It provided a nice message that it cannot perform those requests because the phone does not have the capability.
Great idea and we are sure others are having different experiences. This was ours."
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,Still Learning
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,Still trying to figure this out

One Thing A Day,Very helpful! Looking forward to more episodes!
Store Card,The skill repeatedly did not recognize my 4-digit voice code.
Coinbase Bitcoin/Ethereum Price,It needs price alerts and other features.
BondTrack,I highly recommend this app. It's so easy to use and I like the descriptive information it offers with regards to interest rates and maturity date.
Rocket Mortgage,This app is total garbage.
Capital One,Once you've met your minimum payment you can't  apply any additional payments.  Therefore this is useless because you'd still have to log in to your app or through your computer.

YNAB,"Great in concept....but.....Alexa can't seem to understand the names of many of my categories. I've tried renaming several times with the same effect. Were talking names such Clothing.

Other reason for the 1-star....YNAB needs to spend more time on their web interface and updating their iOS app then playing around with Alexa. Not happy about the ""new"" YNAB...development is extremely slow and things such as basic filtering and having consistent transaction downloads for most of my financial institutes is sorely lacking. I'm actively looking for a replacement."
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,"Looks good, give me a bit to get used to it"
Fast Marketing Minute,"Love the Fast Marketing Minute from Rockin' Robin her advice is ""spot on"" and always helps me stay current with marketing trends, make these quick tips part of your New Year resolution and you will the difference this can make."

Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,This is by far one of the best skills. Definitely worth the wait. I would encourage everyone to try this skill.
Social Media Marketing Tips,
Green Mountain Power,
Rhino Fleet Tracking,By far the best GPS system we've used. Their customer service is unbelievably courteous and speaks ENGLISH : ) They will explain everything you need to know and will relate the features to your business type. These are some smart folks who treat you like a customer should be treated. We've had the system for 6 months and never had any issues(other than our own user errors). It's refreshing to find a company that doesn't have you sign a contract and works very hard to EARN your business. I give them 10 stars
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,It works great!
1st Source Bank,Easy to set up and I can ask Alexa for my balance or last transactions to see if something has cleared without picking up my phone! GREAT!

Matt Miller on Sowing Seed Podcast is that friend! With honest, clean, positive, proactive input, I'd rather start my day with this than most anything else!"

4 Minute Crypto,"4 minutes - or less - everything I need to know about Crypto - and now it's part of my daily update.

Econoday U.S. Economic Flash Briefing,A good selection of U.S. Economic events with highlights that I can understand.
SentinelOne,Having Alexa brief on the state of the environment's endpoint security is really cool. The fact that SentinelOne could create an integration like this says a lot about the flexibility of the platform and integration capability. Alexa will give you an update on alerts and activity in your environment - without even having to log into a console.
Thirty Second Money Tip with Nick True,"Great message, shared with passion and to the point. Money is a huge topic and I look forward to listening to all the other pearls of wisdom that Nick is going to share with us. Well worth a listen. Only 30 seconds of your life. Listen to it while you make a coffee or  buttering that toast."
Keynote Clarity for Thought Leaders with Jon Cook,"As a marketer it can be difficult to to remember that having a clear message the #1 way to serve your clients and your own business.

Keynote Clarity is a part of my morning listening routine to get my day started and in the right mindset."
Marketing School,How do you start a podcast with a quote from a book and forget the name of the book in mid-sentence? How can you call yourself “Marketing School” and not know the difference between strategy and tactics? A complete waste of time. You’d do better reading the articles on the websites for Fast Company magazine or Inc Magazine or following the posts on LinkedIn. This podcast is only for the self promotion of the two guys hosting it.
Sowing Seed Flash Briefing,"He is incredibly gifted when it comes to taking action - yes, this is a gift because so many people have great ideas, but few actually follow up on those ideas. I love the show and love Matt's awesome insight. I can't recommend listening to, learning from, and participating in what Matt does. You will be a better person for it!"
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,"I am disabled, so Alexa, Mastermind and FireTV are a great help to my.  They not only help with my daily tasks, like phone calls, texting.  Ordering my prescriptions.  Making appointments, but helping me keep them.
When the daily tasks are done, it's time for some fun. With all the apps, between Alexa and Mastermind, oh can't forget FireTV.  I have some one to talk to as well as many games to play. There's just so much that it's an exciting way to help me keep up with Life, it's self.  There are Manny things I have yet to introduce, but I don't have the space or time. Speaking of time.  My timer just went off telling me it's time to eat,. See ya..."

Everytime I try to re-enable the skill, it links automatically to the original account. Basically there is no way to edit the account that is linked and unlinking does not delete the underlying account data."

Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,"fair dinkum!  this is a bloody beauty... its like an Aussie developed it... its simple and just does what it says (but im sure it in the background its a busy as a one legged man in a bum kicking competition).  when i get home from a hard day hitting the frog'n toad, this makes my Alexa experience worthwhile.  Even thought the bloody drongos at Amazon havent even switched on the Aussie part of Alexa yet - as if we live out the back of Bourke past the black stump and we don't speak proper good English.  I have renamed Alexa to Shazza just so it doesnt sound like toff nosed Seppo named it.

Love the daily info, insight, tips she shares, and also how responsive Jen is to feedback and suggestions. I saw where someone left a 1 Star review and made offered some constructive criticism. Jen responded quickly and made some changes to when and what she shares. I was delighted to learn Jen also recently implemented one of my suggestions that I had posted in her Facebook group, which was to please note the upcoming days events and designated ""topic/issue"" of the day at least the day before so we had more time to use the information."
Rocket Mortgage,"Made the mistake of giving this company my business for my initial mortgage despite having 3 different better offers they kept going back and forth on honoring to match... Refinance has been the same ordeal, and they keep dropping the ball. Excessively aggressive tactics and pushy sales offering the world...with very poor follow through afterwards. Safe yourself the headaches, time, aggravation, and credit check hits (which WILL impact your score, and raise flags to other lenders)"

Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,Haven’t used it yet. Trouble linking with Alexa
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,Do like it. Just the voice recognition is nowhere near as good as 'Alexa's original'... Most 'commands'  are misunderstood by 'Mastermind'  while trying 'similar' execution without the (kinda annoying command)  'Alexa ask Mastermind to...'  actually works flawless. That's the reason why ppl like Alexa... the voice recognition just works and it's not like 'Siri' calling your mother while all you did was asking what's the weather tomorrow. - So it's just OK for now.. Not sure what needs to be fixed to make voice commands work as they do 'outside' Mastermind in just pure Alexa basic..

MyFortress,"It's kind of annoying to tell her full commands ""Alexa, ask MyFortress to 'whatever'"". It would be great if I could just tell her ""Arm"", ""Disarm"", etc. And it'll be even better if I could add it to a routine. For example: ""Alexa, I'm leaving"", and it would turn off lights, arm the alarm, etc.

Also I think it's unsafe to have to tell her a PIN code out loud to disarm. But I guess it's better than her not asking for anything. I just never use Alexa to disarm.

Adding MyFortress to a Routine would disserve 5 stars."

I love the diversity of the guests, some are experienced sales professionals and some are relatively new SDR's, but the skills and insights they talk about are all actionable. Being an SDR is more martial art than art, and the SDR Chronicles is like going to the Dojo."
Make Me Smart,"... At least about Supersoakers and fireworks. I'm still kinda dumb, but you know... Baby steps!"
Capital One,"I just tried it out. She confirmed my pin and I had no issue getting my account info. She asks if there is anything else... Saying ""that's all""ended the  season. Seems like a handy skill. Haven't tried the pay Bill part yet but id rather do that myself."
Sowing Seed Flash Briefing,"Thanks for the profound guidance and inspiration Matt. You've been there and done it and provided leverage for others to achieve the same. Thanks, ​Matt."
Real Estate,This is a real welcome  change for a real estate search from text box entry to voice automation.  Just ask Alexa including your criteria for the home search and there you have it !!  A list of properties to review. This is beyond anything I have seen Alexa do. I am a Real Estate Professional and have reached out to my buyers with this new product and they are smiling big !!!! Great idea...
Farmers,
Simple Calculator,Alexander does this by her self with out a skill.

Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,"I really loved the beta while I had it.  Only issue was the number of notifications.  This wasn't really wasn't a problem with Mastermind, but instead a phone spam issue that I have started addressing one by one as these spam events occur..

Above said, for some reason Mastermind has stopped working and apparently l need to get in line again to join the beta.  I would gladly pay 15 bucks to get back right away, but don't know how.  I really miss this app!

UPDATE: I've just discovered that I now have Mastermind running again on Alexia.  Apparently when I rebooted my phone after an O/S update (Nexus 6) MasterMind did not restart. Apparently it needs to be always running.  Would appreciate clarification whether this is true.  Also, how I can pay the 15 bucks so I will get the GA version as soon as available."

Mike Hrezo - Valencia Real Estate,"When we made the exciting--yet intimidating--decision to buy a house, we admittedly went with a realtor who didn't really understand us or what we were looking for. We knew we needed to make a change, especially when we started looking in the Valencia area. Mike Hrezo was that change. Scratch that. He was a relief. He instantly understood not only what we were looking for as far as location and budget, but he understood US. Our personalities, our preferences, our dreams. He was upbeat and very professional during the entire process and when we thought we had found our dream home (and then lost it), Mike didn't let us down. He found our real home, the home we live in now, and was a teammate throughout it all.

Looking for a home can be very frustrating, sometimes even heartbreaking, but Mike became a true friend in the process, keeping our best interests at the top. If you're looking for a home in the Santa Clarita Valley, Mike Hrezo is your guy."

Capital One,"I like being able to get my credit card balance on the go.  I also like the idea of being able to make a credit card payment, however, if you have already met your minimum amount due for the month and won't allow you to make an additional payment, even though there's still a balance, therefore you will have to use your app or log into your account online.  I would like to see this fixed to allow a payment to be made when there is a balance on the card, even if there is no minimum amount due."

Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,"Love this Skill/App! Very useful. Still needs some work/improvements but I will pay for it when it goes live.

Called her again to test voice mail but couldn't disconnect the call and had to reset Alexa."

Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,"M
Maks Alexa even more like a family member"
Stock Price,"Listing the current price works well, but including the gain and loss for each stock would be much more useful. I would give 5 stars if it did. I definitely like how stocks can be entered on a list which avoids having to configure this by voice which Alexa rarely gets right on other skills. (The whisper of ""happy trading"" at the end is a bit annoying, but doesn't affect my review.)"

Sounds like a nice guy but not really learning much. More Ethereum and next gen blockchain news please."
MAGA,Just keeping it real. It appears that most of the reviews on here are the folks who wouldn't listen to this channel anyways. I will revise this review after I've listened to it for a week or so. I think it's unfair that you can leave a review without actually ever listening to the station. Frankly I just wanted to up the average from the lame one star haters.
Real Estate,Yeah she can't understand my request...... and she can't find listing (there are 21).

The Indicator from Planet Money,A great way to learn about money and the economy.
Tax Tips With Tyler McBroom,"Tyler McBroom offers excellent advise on taxes and other accounting/financial matters, but the podcast has become almost unbearable because of the non-stop begging for ratings, reviews, and now money literally before, during, and after EVERY episode.  Each podcast has a pre-recorded intro and outro, and it gets very repetitive.  I appreciate the free advice from an expert, but please scale back on the begs."
My Financials,Does not work
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,"This is truly VAPORWARE at this point. The concept seems great but they are funding their development by getting people to lay down $15 for ""Instant Access"" to an application that is still in development. Under the claim of ""closed beta"", they have created a scarcity demand with Alexa users. Don't pay the $15, don't bother to download the app. If or when they release the full version, try it out."
Thirty Second Money Tip with Nick True,I think everyone could use 30 seconds of awesome content from Nick True in their life. A perfect way to kick your day off by refocusing and little tidbits of financial education. Nick's advice and encouragement is spot on!
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,Nice
Front Row Entrepreneur,"I have been listening for the last 3 weeks. It’s great information however I am at a loss of how to take some of this information and apply it to marketing. For example, this morning, it was mentioned that YouTube is going to bookmark or timestamp videos in search results. OK that’s great, but how does that pertain to marketing? Need to discuss how to incorporate these function updates about Facebook/Insta/Twitter/LinkedIn/Youtube into marketing strategies, like with an example of how we could use a new Twitter function for 4th of July."

Think Like a Millionaire - Finance Flash Briefing,"I enjoy listening to this every morning! Ive had this skill enabled for over a year now, and highly recommend!"
Rocket Mortgage,"The last in the title is my largest complaint, unless you double your payment amount going bi-weekly does not cut down the interest because they hold it in escrow.  it adds one payment a year but otherwise is a scam.  Many of mortgage brokers don,t offer it, but those who do take care of their customers.  If you are going to double note the fact its not applied why even do it?  Then for what i refinanced for on a va loan got screwed with fees.  Would never recommend."
The Pitch with Amy Summers,"Easy listen, great perspective, gets you to think about different ways to handle different situations."

Stoopid Money Minute,
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,I liked your product & I use it for the Home.
Make Me Smart,Saw this feature in an email about trying Alexa’s skills. I opened it and then it started working and then the application said “Alexa” when explaining how to use this feature and it just stoped and waited for a new command.... when I re opened the feature it says.... you already heard our latest topic...... and no I didn’t.... You should make sure that whatever is being played does not say Alexia in it or it messes with that function....

Albany Real Estate,Very easy to use.  Extremely helpful in my home search in Saratoga.
The Pitch with Amy Summers,"These tips are great! Also, I love Alexa."
YNAB,"The Alexa app works fine. You cannot choose payee, so you need to adjust from your phone or computer afterwards. It's slower to use than inputting on a screened device. They made Alexa talk or play stuff, too much. She has something to say after you end your session and any time you add something."
Cheddar,I contacted Amazon and they actually replaced two of my Echo Show 5’s because this skill didn’t work. Cheddar video still won’t play and audio freezes EVERY time I listen to my flash briefings on my Show 5’s. Props to Amazon for trying to correct the problem. Thumbs down to Cheddar for not fixing it after the device has been out for several months. Skill is now disabled on all my devices; I’ll find a more reliable source to get my news.
One Minute Retirement Tip with Ashley,I have been listening to Ashley's One Minute Retirement Tip each morning with my coffee for the past few weeks as part of my Amazon Echo Flash Briefing.

Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,I am moving back to an android phone after being on iPhone far too long. I know this app is coming to iPhone towards end of this year.  I am super excited about this App and it’s functionality and it will be one of the top 5 1st apps I download when the phone arrives in the next day or two. I’ve had the skill enabled on Alexa for almost a month since I found out about it and have watched several YouTube videos. Don’t give up too quickly. Be patient when using and learning about this or any app. It takes some time to learn the Alexa commands. The end result makes your screen time dwindle and that’s a huge plus.

A couple of suggestions:
* Find a way to integrate this with the ""Flash Briefing"" feature. I already have Up First, WSJ, and The Daily. I would a short explainer too!
* When the explainer ends, Alexa asks what I want to do next. Is there a way to cancel or tell Alexa to stop waiting? I told her to start my Flash Briefing and she acted confused. Probably this is my error - I haven't used any other skills really."

It baselessly tells you to use a machine learning algorithm, and sometimes even says a certain machine learning algorithm is ""better"" than another. Such algorithms are all different and have their own specific use cases, so comparing them in this way is misleading.

I am surprised this skill made it past certification. Say ""Alexa, open Machine Learning Recommender"" to see what I mean. It says a statement, not sounding anything like a prompt or question, and then waits for input. Most of the time, skills that do this fail to pass certification."

He identified several homes which hit the mark, without wasting our time with houses that did not.

We were thrilled to have Mike as our Agent and will definitely use him again next time!

I don't have Alexa so I didn't get to try it out using Alexa, but the version which connects to Messenger makes budgeting and tracking expenses almost fun! People today are often on messaging apps, but especially on a phone it's inconvenient to try to finagle with a spreadsheet. By allowing people to message BudgetBot the way one messages a friend about movie tickets or restaurant expenses, it's an app that truly brings budgeting to the modern era of those who are on-the-go."

Fidelity Investments,"Terrible. I gave it the names of about 10 popular stocks such as IBM, Procter & Gamble, McDonald's etc. it understood about two of them out of the 10.  A stock qoute service on Amazon echo would be great to have, but this needs a lot of work."

CryptoUpdater,"If you say ""Alexa, ask CryptoUpdater for the latest price of monero"", Alexa will interpret ""monero"" as ""monroe"" or ""more narrow"".  To get this to work, say ""Alexa, open CryptoUpdater"", then ask for price of monero.  This is likely a limitation of the Alexa service rather than the skill itself (I sent some feedback).  Apparently ""Ethereum"" has the same problem."

CryptoCurrency,
Crucial Talks Podcast,
Capital One,"The skill itself isn't bad--in fact I used it for a couple months without issue. My concern is that the pin code necessary to access account information, pay bills, etc is stored as plain text in Alexa's voice history list, and can be read by anyone who looks. 99% of people are not going to know how to go on Amazon through their PC and clear that history, or scroll through hundreds of entries and delete it from the Alexa app. This to me pretty much negates the security aspect of requiring a pin, and so I removed the skill."

Instead of getting a 5 or 10 minute report it goes on and on and on. My wife got so tired of me saying “Alexa skip” that she demanded i remove this skill.

Not only was she impeccable with providing us updates on available homes, but she communicated regularly with us giving her expertise and suggestions on the areas, home costs, etc. As we began looking at homes, we relied on FaceTime and felt confident trusting her judgement to help us find our home! Would highly recommend for any military families or people moving from out of town and don’t have the luxury to be onsite for walkthroughs. From initial discussion to purchase, we loved the experience."

Rocket Mortgage,"Nice commercials showing fast OK by smartphone, but this is NOT the case. They are very slow, they have reviewers that in my opinion are not very smart. Process takes forever as they run their computer algorithms. My friend and I (we have net worth's in excess of $6 million each) tested trying to get a mortgage under $90,000 for homes assessed at $4 million each. They turned us down because too much of our net worth was in equities which they don't count. One level of reviewer after another kept calling … we finally backed out. If you have any smarts at all, you will NOT use this ""lender"". It's a waste of time."

Once I linked my account, she was able to tell me all the info I could want.
But, when I tried to use it to pay my bill, Alexa needed my payment info for her to process the payment.
Supposedly it's all on the account page, but I didn't see anyway to put in my payment info. I tried to go back and try again, but no luck
Once I can get it all fixed, it'll be great.
Maybe they just don't have the skill fully functioning yet.
I'll try again next month."

51 Aliens,
Comcast Business,"Alexa works great in our main conference room.

I hate the old way with our previous provider where you had to look up the phone number, enter the conference id, and then enter in the leader/moderator pin.  Alexa turns on the speaker phone and signs me in automatically.  No more waiting 5 minutes just to get logged in.  Their Comcast Business Companion App also makes this process much easier.

Jeremy over at Comcast Business was also very helpful with the instructions he sent us and following up if we had any issues.  The instructions were clear and step-by-step that anyone can figure it out.  He asked for genuine feedback and ways they can make our life easier.  Look forward in seeing how Alexa and Comcast Business can evolve together.

Comcast Business (BVE) has provided us with many useful ways to speed up and assist with calls.  It's so easy to work remotely due to power loss, bad weather, or any other incident.  We can keep track with Skype if people are working and on call.  We can call people from Skype.  We also have the ability to call via chrome, so when we google a number we can click and be on the phone.  This plus so much more.  Being the IT manager and rolling out new technology you generally get some push back when trying new things, but I have been fortunate enough that its so easy and people see the value right away."

Rhino Fleet Tracking,
Jillian Zhorne - Little Elm Real Estate,"VERY poor experience. Provided poor customer service. Very slow to relay information. Suggested I see her realtor friend's overpriced house first, and upon seeing it, urged me to put in an offer on it ASAP as ""it will go fast."" It was a fix and flip with an already cracked ""custom stone etched concrete patio."" It sat for months and was reduced in price by 15% or so before selling. Consistently late for appointments, time after time. Urged me to use her financing person (Doug Turner at Brazos Bank) and was furious when I told her I was going with a different choice which offered a lower rate. A buyer side realtor should be looking out for my interests, while instead I think she was angry to miss out on potential illegal referral bonus from Doug. Urged me to use her inspector. When I informed her that I had found another one I preferred, she said ""<---inspector name---> I don't know who the heck they are."" Then reiterated I use her inspector and said I couldn't / shouldn't follow the inspector and ask questions. Suggested that her coworker/team leads husband (general contractor) fix a structural issue instead of going through required (for a structural issue no matter how small) permit process. After she quit my transaction, I did get the seller to agree to fix it, and ultimately required them to get a permit. Left me waiting nearly 24 hours before informing me that the seller signed my offer, and only did so after I texted her (for the third time) asking if she had heard anything. This cut into my 7 day option period.  Stated that she ""hates working for the buyer"" the second time I met her (should have been a red flag to walk away, but didnt realize it was so easy to walk away from a realtor).

At any rate, whatever you do, DO NOT believe the 5 star reviews. She quit my transaction after the contract was signed. Then her lead insisted I still had to work with them. I raised heck with Fathom Realty and ultimately they released themselves from the contract as well. Thankfully I was able to get a realtor who was actually willing to work for me and we closed the sale with almost all of what I was requesting from the seller.

Definitely STAY AWAY or you will have a nightmare experience like I did!"

Listening and practicing the skills he speaks of in his podcasts will not only give you the groundwork if you are a new leader but will solidify your effectiveness as a proven leader.

MetLife,
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,"What I like..the best use so far is my reading list while in the car (requires Alexa speaker in car).  It's kinda like a customized audio-book function.

Dislike....its not truly hands-free for making phone calls.  It is hands free for sending text messages w/their MM logo signature attached to your text message ( if using free version) , I cannot answer/reject calls w/voice (on MY phone), it will tell me the caller ID , and it only opens apps.  PC/TV extension for mirror, caller ID notifications are not working.  I have tried to get them to show on the PC/TV, and this feature has not worked since skill enabled (approx 2 weeks)  It has other skills like reading/scheduling your calendar (via Alexa), but who is going to sit around their speaker all day telling MM to do it when Google assistant/Alexa already does it.  I must say that it has to have more practical use before it's worth any money.  I watched their video, and they should give a list of phones that they are compatible with."

I'd prefer a. command ""Give watchlist details"" to get performance of each stock spoken by Alexa vice the app.  Still a good skill."

Looking for a job,
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,"So far to me this is the best skill on the Alexa Echo. As soon as I got signed up, within 10 mins I finished setting up all the components including the chrome integration. Everything so far as worked exactly how it's supposed to. Super easy setup.

Update: 4/10/17
I have now easily added my wife's account to the echo under her profile. Now waiting for Mastermind to update.

Still a 5 star rating, I have used all the commands at one point or another over the past 5 days. Everything works as advertised. I do get a few times when the echo can't seem to understand what I'm asking for but usually if you repeat once it picks up."
Store Card,"I try to log in my account, and the skill page reloads over and over."
The Motley Fool,"I don't care what some people say, Alexa can't understand some of the company names.  For instance when I wanted to know the current price of ""The Trade Desk"" which you would think would be easy to understand but she just doesn't.  EVEN THOUGH SHE HAS THE TRADE DESK ON  MY WATCH LIST! AND SHE PRONOUNCES IT PERFECTLY WHEN IT HAPPENS TO BE THE BIGGEST WINNER OR LOSER IN MY PORTFOLIO.  It is very frustrating because I don't have problems with communicating with Alexa for anything else. Also I had added stocks that I didn't want because she misunderstood me.  I don't know of a way to get her to list the stocks on my watch list. Like many people have been saying their needs to be a way to edit your watch list so that you can correct the app.  It is very hard to keep control because she misunderstands you and could add/subtract stocks on you watch list.  I have stopped using the app.  I really don't need to know the daily fluctuations.  But it was fun while it lasted.  I used it for about a year."

YNAB,"First let me say I absolutely love YNAB, no exaggeration it changed our family's life (with Dave Ramsey). But we integrate Alexa into our home to make certain tasks easier. YNAB on Alexa does not make YNAB tasks easier, I end up spending more time fixing what I did via Alexa than if I had just waited to enter transactions on the PC. The inquiries seem to work well (what's my balance in such and such category) but entering transactions feels cludgy and does not save me time. I'm probably going to disable the skill, but will to continue use YNAB on the web and iOS. Now if I could get reports and search on iOS, I could die happy!"

Toke Ettehadieh - Houston Real Estate,"Toke is the absolute best!  My mother decides to sell her property after 40 years. Toke took time out of her busy day to meet my mother at her home. She was extremely patient explaining  the process to my mother. After two weeks on the market and a potential buyer on the hook, my mother decides to stop and not sell. Two months go by,  my mother decides it's time to sell the property, again.  Toke so graciously puts her sign back on the property. Within the first 30 days,  ""Super"" Toke puts on her cape and sells the property for full ask! The highest ""Sold"" property in the  neighborhood.  Toke's honesty and integrity makes her ""Super""!"

I won't waste my morning minutes listening to ads.  Plus, on Flash Briefing it automatically plays the past 5 or so morning shows, not just the latest one.

Rocket Mortgage,"For the past two weeks, we have made multiple to attempts to close our loan application with Quicken due to a handful of odd communications between AMROCK, their closing firm, and our realtors. All realtors involved suggested we switch to another lender immediately which we have been trying to do for two weeks to no avail. When you have a problem with Quicken, the person assigned to your account just gives up and sends you to a 1-800 number in Detroit. We spoke with someone who promised us it would be handled within 24-48 hrs. Two weeks later, I just received a message from someone else saying ""We have been trying to reach you, if you dont get back to us tonight we will be withdrawing your account and youll have to apply again."" No one contacted us and we are being threatened with the exact thing we asked them to do. This has been unprofessional and nauseating. I would NEVER trust Quicken or Rocket Mortgage to handle my child's piggy bank, let alone a mortgage. Do not work with these people as you will find yourself in big trouble if something out of the ordinary should arise."

Market Moment - Today in History,"Want to impress a few coworkers with your knowledge of market history?  How about a fun fact for a cocktail party?  Then Market Moment is the Alexa skill for you.  Hosted by Josh Brown, a financial commentator on CNBC's Halftime Report and the CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management, Market Moment is the ""Today in History"" of the stock market variety.

I enjoy Market Moment because it highlights something fun and intriguing from financial history and allows me to expand my knowledge base.  Check it out."
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,This addition to Alexa with the help of a Muse makes hands free a reality and for a whole lot less than the $150/year UConnect wants to charge.  I'm learning more ways to use it and am extremely happy.  I haven't perfected adding punctuation to my texts yet but I'm sure juat another thing I'll learn. 4 stars only because there are still occasional miscues and periods when functions are temporarily down.  It's a BETA and technology so it's expected.

Front Row Entrepreneur,"Fun, Focused, and Full of Value. Jen delivers a daily navigation through the Social Media Space that saves me time and points me in the right direction.  My first encounter with Jen was in her free Summer Camp pop up group.  I was impressed by the amount of value she provided in that group, and thoroughly enjoyed the level of engagement and activity. Jen is very generous with her time and her knowledge. I have implemented several of her lessons in my own business and social media strategies, and am loving the results.  When Jen started doing her flash briefings I was totally on board because of my previous experience with her teaching. I have not been disappointed. I look forward to hearing Jen's daily summary of top tech news, and social media trends and pivots. Thanks Jen for doing all the work for me!  This briefing is a great addition to my mornings, and Jen's easy and fun style fits right in with the way I approach my day.

Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,Alexa and phone integration is amazing. Very useful almost on a daily basis.
Stock Prices,"This would be great if I didn't have so much trouble with Alexa hearing different letters than what I'm actually saying.  For example, the letter 'D' is often heard as 'P', even though I speak it very slowly and accentuate as clearly as I can.  It would be very helpful if there was a way to pre-set single words with stock symbols in a list [somewhere].  Using company names is not good, and is why I chose this skill over others.  Not all stock symbols are associated with a company, such as ETF's, which typically have extremely long [multi-word] names that I certainly don't want to have to remember."

Experian,"When I ask Alexa “What is my credit score?”, she will initiate the Experian skill by asking me for my personal key (which we all set up, I guess, for obvious privacy and security reasons). After my successful answer, she will reply that she can’t access Experian’s servers.

I think this needs fixing."

Donnie Keller - Fort Worth Real Estate,"I was referred to Donnie by a friend John Unsworth. He had a rental property that was giving him issues and told me Donnie got him top dollar and did it fast. I was having person issues in a relationship I was in and figured it would be easier to sell the house than go through a eviction process. My property had a nice home on a terrible lot. Donnie met with me went over a detailed plan to get top dollar for my house quickly. He told me what I needed to do to get my house ready for sale and how he was going to market it. I had my end of the bargain done in a week. He listed my home and had a open house that first weekend and had “glamor shots” of my house done. I cannot over emphasis how bad my lot was. Zero lot lines and a two level backyard. This was a challenge. Donnie had my house sold within 3 weeks and got why I felt was top of the mark considering the poor lot. I highly recommend him. He is not a realtor to list your house on MLS and wait for a offer he is proactive, professional and has a plan. Highly recommend.
Rob Bailes"
Run To Your Leadership Challenges!,"I enjoyed listening but I stopped when he began discriminating against women. He admitted he refuses to meet with women alone for work purposes unless his wife is there or it is in a group setting.
This recommendation he gave is a big problem, because it undoubtedly will decrease the opportunities women have at work. The last thing women need right now is even more isolation. Men vastly outnumber women as managers and senior leaders, so when they avoid, ice out or exclude women, we pay the price.

Not worth listening to."

Capital One,"Great product, but every time I try to use Alexa's default Wikipedia search to look up information about my favorite farts, it keeps opening the Capital One Skill instead. Why is my banking app registering that phrase?"
Make Me Smart,"I’ve actually been wondering. Well, yah know, ‘Kai Ryssdal’ is so obvious I just couldnt help it. 🙃

OK, *serious 🧐 face* for a sec. I see tremendous potential for Alexa as a user interface for collecting listener feedback. For the focus-challenged, mental-landscape wandering, MMS-wavelength oriented regular like me, Alexa is a means for collecting succinct, directed, scope-defined responses in near real time and conveniently in podcast-friendly audio format. Perhaps this isnt a widespread problem with the MMS audience at large, but I personally struggle to provide feedback despite frequently having the strong desire to do so, because I simply have too much I’m inspired to say. If i were to write an email response, I would have trouble keeping it at sub-Tolstoyian lengths. Though well-intentioned, it would be a challenge to integrate into podcast format and may not make it back to yall before relevence has diminished in the wake of the latest outrage or executive faux pas . But interfacing via the echo, I can easily capture and send my feedback as my response arises to my mind while taking advantage of fast, integrated voice commands to execute.  I suspect there will be an efficiency gain back at the studio, too, since the various commands that can be assigned to trigger recording can also be used to triage the incoming responses.

I really hope to see this aspect expand to include more Alexa skills/commansthemes like block chain, meta-data & data rights (I have so much to say on that, Molly. So much. And pre-Cambridge Analytica, I was a very lonely warrior...lol). And of course, to collect responses to the MMS signature question, so brilliantly designed to induce individual self-reflection while facilitating empathic bonding (both soft skills badly needed in these times of growing ideological division).

Bottom line: I cant wait to try it out! Also, you guys rock!! So much! Thanks for being people i like to like, and who like what i like, and who make the world a better place by advocating positive and intelligent cohesion 😇!"

Some days I can't get around so well or I forget and I leave my phone in another room and don't have the energy to go track it down but now that Alexa has ""found her a man"" all I have to do is speak and the two of them get done for me what I am unable to do. I remember watching movies and Star Trek as a kid and thinking 'wouldn't that be cool', guess what? It is! Thank you to the parents of this app, especially Nik who has been very patient and most helpful."
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,So far so good! Keep up the good work.

But I took a chance because the other review said that ""the info is good but volume is too low"" So I enabled and found that EVERYTHING IS AWESOME for me :) The episode I heard was so valuable on ""Top 7 FREE YouTube Video Makers"" simply loved it... I guess Digital Pratik, actually works on the feedback of people. He might have changed the tone and might have acted upon the feedback for sound quality of the podcast. If that is the case, then I would RATE THIS 10 STAR RATING!!!"

She is clearly very knowledgeable and extremely passionate about her work.  You can tell how much she enjoys helping her clients, too. Her book recommendations continue to be terrific, which feels like such an added bonus. Often times, I find myself getting the books she recommends. Lastly, she has a keen understanding of investing across generations, so her tips typically include the nuance for various ages and stages of life/investing, broadening her audience and the number of people she can tangibly support. She is all around impressive!  I am a big fan."

Donnie Keller - Fort Worth Real Estate,"Donnie was extremely helpful and patient.  We were under a great deal of stress with time constraints, sale issues with our business in another county & health concerns with my husband.

Faith Harmer - Las Vegas NV Real Estate,"Faith and her team came through for us on everything we asked for. She knows Las Vegas and is solidly in your corner.  She gave us honest feedback on houses and neighborhoods instead of just trying to close a deal. We have had plenty of agents in the past that have let us down, but Faith exceeded our expectations. We would HIGHLY recommend Faith, her team, and Urban Nest."
BizMagic Minute,I look forward to these tips every day.

Chandler Real Estate Update,I appreciate the Chandler real estate market update
Marketplace Tech,"I love the content (minus the ads), but it plays every episode from the past 5 days or so in reverse sequential order, and I need to have Alexa skip each one individually. I've noticed this with other flash briefing skills too, so maybe it's something Amazon changed on the server side. Please look into this."
Hank's Marketing and Business Tips,Hank is the BOMB at social media marketing strategies and more. His daily tips help me easily and efficiently market my business.
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,"Mastermind helps to use your phone using Amazon Alexa. Messages and notification are perfectly read by Alexa. However making phone calls and text messages, it didn't recognise the contacts rightly. Over-all a great concept."
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,"Brilliant idea. The Android app itself is solid, works well, and has so far been completely free of bugs. The signup process is a bit complex but being a closed beta that's understandable. As far as the service & Alexa app are concerned, it works pretty well. There are little kinks here & there but far fewer than you would expect and they are quick to update to fix things, incorporate new features, refine current features, & take customer feedback extremely seriously & effectively. A few more iterations of the up, updates, & time to expand and it will be not only a solid five star app but perhaps the one killer app for the Echo there is. Bravo guys."
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,Fine
iPay QuickPay℠,"enabled skill, trying to ""link account"" took me to a website where you can only enter in existing logon credentials, no place on the website for new users to sign up, can't use it if i can't create an online account. worthless, disabled skill.
i'd give this 0 stars if i could, but i had to give it one star...ugggg"

Toke Ettehadieh - 77057 Real Estate,"Toke is the absolute best! My mother decides to sell her property after 40 years. Toke took time out of her busy day to meet my mother at her home. She was extremely patient explaining the process to my mother. After two weeks on the market and a potential buyer on the hook, my mother decides to stop and not sell. Two months go by, my mother decides it's time to sell the property, again. Toke so graciously puts her sign back on the property. Within the first 30 days, ""Super"" Toke puts on her cape and sells the property for full ask! The highest ""Sold"" property in the neighborhood. Toke's honesty and integrity makes her ""Super""!

The only issue I had with installation of the skill is that there was not a clear indication of the skill being connected or operating normally.
Operation of the skill was confirmed only after I used the voice command for the skill, and the alarm system responded to the command.
This skill is easy to use, and requires a pass code to disarm the alarm system.
I like it  👍👍👍."

Would be cool if in the future there would be more currencies supported"

RealChoice Benefit Program,great way to learn about JH benefits
Bloomberg,"This is by far my favorite skill on my Echo Show. You can use this skill to live stream Bloomberg TV channel, which is to my knowledge the only live-streaming video channel (news or otherwise) on Echo Show. And the video feed is rock solid steady and good quality (depending on your internet connection to be of course). No bugs or stream fails like sometimes happens with radio or in the flash briefing. In addition to be a good service to viewiers, it’s a model for others in the sector (both content providers like CNN, CNBC, etc., and service providers like the cable TV companies, cord cutting live streaming TV services like Hulu TV, AT&T DirecTV, etc.) who are racing to bring TV content to our phones, tablets and other screens to take note of.  My Echo Show sits on my desk all day and right now Bloomberg has a monopoly on live streaming TV news to this screen."

Front Row Entrepreneur,"Just activated The Front Row Entrepreneur on Alexa. Love Jen Lehner's quick daily update on social media and other digital stuff. And her review of the Headliner app was great. I always wanted to know how to add text/closed captioning to video and audio. Hard to believe this app is free. The quick flash briefing is a fun way to start my day, right after I ask ""Alexa, what's the weather today""?"

Amex,Convenient!
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,"Worth the 15 beans, exactly what I was looking for.  There is a way to stop the ringing on my phone, (s5 galaxy) just slide down top menu. I just wish you could control the phone volume that would be dope!  Often my phone's ringers are set to quiet. Therefore couch cushions are still the enemy. Otherwise this is awesome! 5 ☆"

Leticia Sotomayor - Chino Real Estate,"We recently closed on our first home purchase, and we had engaged Leticia and Team for the process. We were very picky during the search, but Leticia and her team were very patient with us and also were always available to take us see any property we wanted to see. When we decided on the house we  wanted, Leticia and Alberto stepped in during the negotiation, and we got our offer accepted in no time even though we offered much less below asking price. The whole process went smooth till closing and the whole Leticia team was prompt and knowledgeable and professional. They even got us a generous credit from the seller towards our closing costs. When we finally moved into the new house, Alberto even gave us a call to check on how we were settling in. The whole team is very friendly and easy to work with, and we will definitely be recommending our friends and people we know, to try Leticia and team, whether they are buying or selling.

Thanks Leticia and Team"

Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,"Needs some tweaking. Overall it's a great concept. Some new features would be cool. Like maybe go control your phone (turn off WiFi with echo). Sometimes when I ask what battery I have left, Alexa can't tell me and I have to disable and re-enable the skill. Overall for a closed beta it's showing great promise."

Store Card,"First, let me just say, I totally don't get all the reviews with people frustrated and saying things like “Let Me Just Pay My Bill” or asking why Alexa is the only way to manage their Store Card, it isnt... Simply goto Amazon.com, scroll all the way to the bottom and choose the “Amazon.com Store Card” link. It’s listed Under “Amazon Payment Products”  (3rd Column from the Left, 2nd Item Down).

Anyway hopefully that help curb the Skill Hate. Otherwise the Skill really was great when it was working. Ive been getting Technical Difficulty messages for a couple months now, and I really hope those get resolved soon. 5-Star Skill, that is currently only getting 3 because it is broke. Please Fix!"

Patrick has an uncanny ability to find homes satisfying virtually all of our constraints in our specific areas of interest. He is also aware of certain off-market properties that may be  available. These ""pocket listings"" are a tremendous resource for Patrick's clientele. His length of time and experience in the entire Monterey Peninsula has also enabled him to show us very desirable neighborhoods of which we were unaware."

Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,Fantastic!
Store Card,"A disputed transaction/amount will become a nightmare for the consumer who had the misfortune of using the Amazon store card. Even with documented proof the disputed charge will sit there on your account,the bank will take 60 days to ""investigate"" and another 10 or more days to let you know about their ""investigation"". This card will not provide you with any real shopping benefits and Synchrony Bank should be given the 'worst customer service ever' award.

Don't get this card or any card this bank is behind. You will regret it big time. As for Amazon it is turning into a really really bad shopping experience so it is only a matter of time till consumers turn to something else.  Can't wait!"

Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,Awesome
Capital One,"The app was fine enough while it worked, but I've used Capital One exactly twice now and the Alexa App or the Mobile App failed each time.  Both times it took several days to get anyone from the bank to address it.  The second time, even though we troubleshooted with the level 1 support and it was determined to be a back end issue, the digital team closed out my issue with a standard response to ""call amazon"".  Very frustrating.  I chose this bank because they appeared so tech savvy.  Clearly they are not."
Thirty Second Money Tip with Nick True,"While he seems like he is giving you good advice, most of good advice he is giving you are ripped right from Dave Ramsey. That wouldn't be so bad, except for two things: (1) He never credits Dave Ramsey (while Dave would be first person to admit his advice is not all that original, when Nick is stealing the whole ""debt snowball"" without a single nod to the person who came up with the phrase, well, that's stealing), and (2) He twists some advices, turning a good one into a terrible one (I've heard several, but the one where it is glaring is what Nick calls ""debt avalanche"").

Just get it straight from the source and listen to Dave Ramsey. Skip this guy."

It does everything it says it does and works seamlessly with no hiccups or issues at all.  I get my messages read to me. I send text messages without having to touch my phone.  I have 3 Alexa units throughout my house so the intercom feature comes in very handy. I didn't know I needed it until I downloaded Mastermind and found it by mistake.  I can even make phone calls with my cell phone upstairs charging while I'm downstairs cooking.

I'm sure I'll be using this app more than any other on my phone.  So give it a try.  It's definitely worth downloading."

Review Removal Help Center by Objection Co,Thank you Objectionco for your tips on getting a review disputed.  The information you provided was very helpful.  It didn't seem fair for a third party who didn't even have an interaction with the business to write a review.  They didn't even really have an experience themselves.  So I was really glad to know that this type of review could be disputed and hopefully removed.  It was very handy to just ask Alexa and get this information.  So user friendly.  Thank you Amazon for having this feature on Alexa!

Thirty Second Money Tip with Nick True,Great reminders about money topics everyday.
Run To Your Leadership Challenges!,"I like the content provided, but it could do without the injection of religion. I’ve listened to this guy for a couple months and felt the subject matter was great for new leaders and even a helpful refresher for the more experienced. Lately, I have noticed he is more frequently quoting the Bible and uses Jesus in his comparisons. Unfortunately his delivery style is a bit too preachy for me, and I would have preferred he took a more objective approach when using religious references. That being said, I do recommend this briefing for practicing Christians."
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,Great
The Pitch with Amy Summers,"I recently went back to school to pursue a new career. Being in my 30's, I was a bit nervous on how the experience would go.

He is honest, hardworking, available, professional, and an absolute dream to work with.  I can't imagine there is a better realtor out there.  I've recommended him to multiple family members and friends over the years, and they all say the same thing.  I will continue to use Mike for all of future real estate transactions.  He is the best!"
PMI Customer Care,
Tell me why the market moved,we like it at home.  they provide good information about some of the reasons  why the stock market does what it does.
StartupInfo,Could only get this app to provide information on large startups. I attempted over a dozen well known smaller startups but the app would not respond at all for any of them or would provide info about a large startup that barely sounded similar to the startups being quried. It would be nice to be able to spell the startups name and also for the app to tell you it could not find information on the startup versus jist cutting off when the startup name is not recognized.
Small Business Marketing Tips,"I start each day listening to Bobbi’s high-value business tips. Having her in my daily flash briefing is a MUST for me.

Emirates NBD,Well built
Experian,
Prudential Retirement,Nice to get my information without digging through my computer.  Thank you Prudential.
BondTrack,"You just need to know the CUSIP numbers for the bonds that you want to look up.  Once you provide the CUSIP you can ask for lots of different information like the last trade price or date, yield, maturity date, issuer, coupon rate.  You can even ask for a yield to maturity given a specific price.  Understanding improves the more you use it."

Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,"What a disappointment. I'm disabled I was hoping to use this app to text my contacts when my phone is not accessible. Little did I know you had to click on a notification to send the text after Alexa said to. I guess I will keep using scribe. Yes, I have to change the number every time. But at least it's useful to those with disabilities"""
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,its ok but stop for updates

Mike Hrezo - Valencia Real Estate,My husband and I bought a home with Mike and his team. They were extremely knowledgeable about the current real estate market and always available to speak to us if we had questions- day or night! We were able to get our home for below market value and during the whole buying process we felt like we were in the best hands. We would highly recommend Mike Hrezo and his team!
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,Instead of spending time looking for your phone just ask Alexa and she'll tell you what's going on with your phone love this app

Marketplace Morning Report,"I listen to Marketplace Morning Report everyday. I used to use NPR One, but now it just streams via this and then goes on to the other briefings my household want. Marketplace's team is word class; David Brancaccio has done excellent in depth reporting across the nation. I particularly enjoyed his series on how Automation might effect the economy.

My only regret is that I can not find the BCC's Marketplace Morning Report..."

Allstate,No problem linking account and it works flawless to get basic information. Great potential for added features!
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,Very very useful
YakStat,This is the best Yakkin app ever created
Thirty Second Money Tip with Nick True,"It’s great if they could fix the volume. It’s too quiet and if you tell Alexa to raise the volume multiple times so you can hear him speaking, the next skills BLAST from the speaker. I had to sadly disable this skill. By the way-Amazon techs are completely useless when trying to fix volume problems. Don’t waste your time contacting them."
Experian,seems like almaot every skill does not work. dont the people developing these skills test them.
Front Row Entrepreneur,"As a business owner, we need to stay relevant in the market. Jen's Front Row Entrepreneur briefing is invaluable as it keeps us on the up and up in social and digital news. Jen always gives information from a practioner's point of view and her opinions and teachings are spot on. This is one briefing you don't want to miss each day if you're a business owner and manage your own social media marketing."

Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,"Amazon needs too do a better job of keeping scrubs out.

Not sure this is even legal, or what service they providing for a fee."
Fox Business,Short and clear. Exactly what I was looking for...
Keynote Clarity for Thought Leaders with Jon Cook,"Keynote Clarity is part of my everyday routine. Jon's insight is clear, focused, and so practical. I'm getting tremendous insight every day from this flash briefing. It's the only one I'm subscribed to any more because I don't want to miss what Jon says by another flash briefing playing after his. If you want to jump out from the crowd as a speaker, podcaster, business coach, influencer, you HAVE to listen to Jon. Great flash briefing!!!"
Front Row Entrepreneur,"Jen Lehner's flash briefing, Front Row Entrepreneur, is a great way to stay up to date on ever-changing social media trends.  I listen first thing in the morning and appreciate her clear, simple, ""real"" delivery of information.  I've since discovered her website, blog, FB group,...which provides a ton more useful information."
Store Card,"I got this because I thought it would be a faster way to check and pay it off I just checking your balance can take a considerable amount of time due to all the extra fluff they have Alexa say additionally it seems like payments take significantly longer to post when you use the app andlately it hasn't updated my account
since April"
Ohio Real Estate,Very useful
Ethereum Price,Best Ethereum App out there
The Pitch with Amy Summers,"If you do any kind of publicity, marketing or pitching in your business, you need to subscribe to The Pitch with Amy Summers. Amy brings a fresh voice and an insider's knowledge of high-level business networking to her briefing. It features tips and advice you can implement in your own business, as well as reminders of important business etiquette so many neglects to implement. She demonstrates that it really is about relationships and that no pitch is effective if your behavior around the pitch doesn't show authenticity. Highly recommended!"

Daily Shot of Social Media for Realtors,"I found Sandie's flash briefing by searching for ""social media"" news updates for my Alexa device. She provides very actionable info with clear explanations, and she gets right to the point. The best part of her detailed explanations is the way she walks you through each step. Glad this is part of my daily flash briefing routine!"
Fidelity Investments,Just tried it and it is okay. Limited on the amount of quotes available. Like I could could not get quotes for Baidu or Zoe's Kitchen. Good if you only own the biggest stocks.
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,I am not able to send a text.
Front Row Entrepreneur,Jen always is on top of the social media news. I count on her briefing regularly to help me keep up to date on what is changing and what are the top marketing tools. If you have an online biz you'll want to tune into this briefing. I joined her free facebook group and then upgraded to her business membership as she is always giving crucial information and tutorials on what you need to know for online biz. She is hugely helpful!
The Perfect Gentleman,xo

Agent Pipeline Sales Tips,
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,"It's not even fair to the app or the developers to have this rating system because you can't even accurately judge the app according to its capabilities because The Echo doesn't understand anything you try to command. It took me 17 times to Send a text message to ""Josh"". Believe it or not to the name ""Josh"" I just kept getting dropped. Hopefully Amazon their glorified piece of garbage alarm clock before they solely ruin the opportunity this app has to shine!"
The Mastermind Play Book: Building A Richer Life,Great way to put a positive message into your day. Aaron does s great job helping you get the most out of life with his wisdom and past experiences.
Credit Card Helper,"It was refreshing to find something cool. I'm looking for a great cash back card and got a recommendation from ""Carl"". When I checked a few sources online, the recommendation was hands down the best. It seems like these guys check their stuff. Great if you're thinking of getting better cards. Evaluates them too."

I learned about the Alexa Skills app through Dustin. I know him personally and consider him a friend . He is THE Salt Lake City Real Estate expert.
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,This is probably the best skill. IOS need not apply since apple won't let us play in their sandbox it's only fair.
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,"I like the skill itself and understand it is in beta, but I don't like that it puts “Sent via Mastermind on Alexa” on every text I send. Other than that I would give it 5 stars."

"Entrepreneurs, and start ups Tips",
Tour de Profit with Rich Allen,"In our busy day and age, we don't have time for several 45 minutes podcasts daily. But a one minute flash briefing like Rich's? Thank you!"
cavness HR Podcast,Intros for east guest take way too long. I don't need their entire life story to hear their advice on HR topics. Content is painfully dry and I love educational talk radio so it has to be pretty bad for me to speak up. Drags on and doesn't even have insightful comments. I'm disappointed. Will try again in 6 months to see if you figured this out.
Teach Me Negotiations,great content on negotiations training!!
Front Row Entrepreneur,"I listen to Jen Lehner's flash briefing every morning as I settle in at my desk and organize my thoughts (I'm an author, social media strategist, and online community-builder). There's always some useful nugget about the world of social media and entrepreneurship that's timely and useful. I love the way Jen mixes things up by sometimes including segments like mini-interviews with other entrepreneurs (the business book suggestions have been great) and it's always good to know what's coming up in terms of 'special' days. Make Your Bed Day? Who knew?

With her cheerful, easy-going demeanor,  Jen is a pleasure to listen to - she sets a light, positive tone for the rest of my day! My only teeny tiny beef is the briefing only arrives Monday-Friday and though I know it's not ideal from a work-life balance perspective, I often work on weekends. When I find myself at my desk on a Saturday morning I can't help but wonder, ""Where's Jen?"" So, yeah - I'm a fan-girl! Keep up the great work, Jen!"
Westmarc,Liked hearing whats going on in the west valley
Interview Me,I wish alexa could ask more in depth
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,Everything I've tried to do on here has worked since first installed. A few words have been mis-understood by Alexa on texts but not enough to matter. It is the perfect compliment to Alexa.
Charles Schwab,Alexa can do most of what this is supposed to do without the additional (broken) skill.
Bitcoin Info,Doesn't work.
Bloomberg,"I used to use this app every day to watch Bloomberg.  Now that I can no longer watch live Bloomberg TV, i no longer use this app.  This would be 4 to 5 stars if I could."
The Mastermind Play Book: Building A Richer Life,"Not worth listening to, nothing innovative or interesting here."
YNAB,

CMI Appointment Monitor for Dentech,"The all new Dentech with ""Check Me In"" allows an enhanced Alexa experience at work.  Be continuously in touch with the progress of appointments through your office right from the Alexa Show screen.  The modern digital dental office now goes even further into the digital world.  Easy to install and use.  A blast to use at work!"
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,looks cool but cant try it. needs the companion app
Unofficial Ripple (XRP) Ticker,"Works exactly as expected!

Update 12/14: Still works exactly as expected.  Not sure why Debbie thought it was the wrong price, but it's always right in line with what my other sources say."
Prudential Retirement,"I set up skill and worked for awhile until wife set up her app & pin (which never worked) and then mine stopped working. Even when it did work it was kind of weird that you had to give a pin even if you had Alexia set up to recognize your voice. I mean the app only gives your balance it doesn't transfer funds, etc."
Naples Real Estate,Amazing group of people so tirelessly focused on finding “home” for their customers.
Marketplace Tech,Deleted because it keeps playing the same over and iver
Numerica,I love that I can transfer money and hear my balance with Alexa.
CryptoPrice,This one is really so useful for me as the price is getting updated so frequently. Very nice and clean work on this one. I am waiting for that update that will remind me automatically when price changes with range
Front Row Entrepreneur,"I feel like I'm ""in the know"" on all things coming down the social media and beyond pipeline. Plus I just love listening to Jen in general. Appreciate that I get this in Messenger + on my Alexa. It's all positive too, which is just the news I want to hear!"

Safelite,"As a user of this new skill, we appreciate your input"
Business Freedom Daily Briefing,"You, the small business owner drowning in the repetitiveness of working in your business (because you say to yourself, ""no one can do it quite like I can""...) instead of on your business.

Store Card,I WOULD LIKE TO PAY LESS FOR A PRIME MEMBERSHIP !
Capital One,Works great for my savings account but apparently doesn't support loans. Would be great to be able to pay my auto loan and get principal amount.
Capital One,Amazing! I love this app!
The Motley Fool,"While I was pleasantly surprised to find this skill... The reality of the functionality (or more correctly, lack thereof) was utterly disappointing.

As others have said over the past year, the difficulty in simply adding a stock to watch (or even pull information on) remains the largest, though most important, obstacle in this skill.

I tried entry via full company name, as well as symbol. Only one was successful of 8-10 companies (16-20 attempts). Not good."
4 Minute Crypto,
Shawna Korth - Your Aurora Real Estate Agent,
The Pitch with Amy Summers,"These tips are great for everyone! From building confidence in the professional world to general communication tips, everyone can and should use Amy’s advice."
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,The app helps me look at what's on my phone through the Amazon echo
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,"As I am still rather new/novice to this system, I am not too keen on all it's abilities, bit also fascinated by the learning process 🙂"
Capital One,"Works well, but could really use some improvements. For starters, it would be nice to hear your most recent transactions when you ask for recent transactions. Instead, Alexa tells me the largest transactions in the past 30 days. What I really want to know is what went through yesterday! Also, would really like to see more support for bill pay and P2P payments, especially for accounts I already have set up. Overall, it's good for hearing your current balance though."

Fox Business,i finally turned this off. 2 to 3 minutes of hearing the same Net Suites advertisement day after day??? I guess I’ll skip gettimg ny favorite news channel on my Alexa morning routine. TERRIBLE. Give me a break. i just woke up and btw now i hate Net Suites. I’m afraid their marketing plan is backfiring.
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,Alexa was working fine days ago to check anything on your phone and now nothing is supported. They screwed you over with only google. Don't bother now people. It's not worth it
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,I think Mastermind ROCKS
Wake 'em Up Public Speaking with Tom Antion,These are great public speaking tips!
Thirty Second Money Tip with Nick True,"Decent peraonal discipline and building routine tips. Money tips? Not so much. Plus, his point of view is rather limited to a privileged white guy. So if that is you, it might work."

Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,I just downloaded this app so far it's working great although it's trying to turn on a TV that I don't own LOL
One Minute Retirement Tip with Ashley,"I have a lot of things in my daily briefing, so I don't want anyone to be too long. Ashley's tips are to the point, really helpful, and down to earth. I like how she seems like a real person. It's like a good friend giving retirement advice that always makes you think about ways to improve. Will be keeping this one!"
Web Analytics,

Make Me Smart,Engaging and useful skill. Probably my favorite so far.
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,"This is one of the most essential skills I have: when you're too lazy to open your phone your voice assistant just tell you what your latest notification was, what your phone battery is (which most phone carriers' own voice assistants aren't able to do); I can confirm this works seemlessly. Only wish there was a privacy policy in place but then this skill is so useful that I continue to use"

Harvard Business Review: Management Tip,"These are short (60 sec.) tips that cover a single topic ranging from things like "";Make sure your meetings are useful by setting goals..."" to ""How to approach stress management and how it improves performance"". Most seem to be adapted from articles in the HBR and summarized in a way that makes them seem like common sense. Even so each is a good reminder to maintain mindfulness on a variety of topics. Thankfully there are no ads or drives to the full HBR, just a simple straight-forward delivery of a tip."

Good job. Keep improving this!"

Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,"Im changing my 3 star to a five star rating and here is why? After posting my review around 12 hours later i git an email from Nik the man behind Mastermind. He told me that after reading about the ussues i was having with my phone, he and his team spent all day trying to figure out the fixes. He explained the type of phone I havethe Galaxy Note 4 a 3 year old phone might not be able to use some of the features, how ever after a long day of trouble shooting he gave me clear and simple instructions on what I needed to do which included the app update that included the fixes for my phone. He did say do to the phone type the answering the phone access might not work. So i did as instructed and BAM all but the 1 feature as he said worked. I can live without that 1 feature. He did say if I upgraded my phone to a newer version, that I would be able to have ALL features working. Well I love my phone so I'll settle with the no answering part. Everything else works amazingly. I'll leave my first review up so you can get the idea. 5 star for app, 5 STAR FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. Thank you Nik for going out of your way to make a customer happy.  (Original review paid the $15.00 to not have to wait. I've been trying this out for over 2 hours. I have the amazon echo, my phone is the samsung galaxy note 4. I've tried all the features out. Most of them work and some do not. I'm disappointed that there is some that doesn't work since I paid not to wait. Here is what is not working. Send call to voicemail when I have a incoming call. Ring my phone doesn't ring my phone, accept an incoming call that doesn't work. Get notification's it says I don't have any when I do, when I listen to my status update it does not tell me I missed a call as it shows in your video. It does everything else perfectly so I'm half happy I'd give this 5 stars if I was able to have everything working since I paid 15 bucks not to wait. Any help would be great. I did disable the skill and re-enabled it, also I removed the app and reinstalled it to my phone to see if that would help and it did not. Like I said everything else works great but I'd like it all to work please. What do I do?)"

She has been generous enough to offer additional support via email and suggestions beyond her daily tips that you can take advantage of or not! It's up to you. If there's a day that the tip is something that you may find does not apply to you, you simply would say, ""Alexa, skip"" and move on... I have not done that yet!

Mike Hrezo - Valencia Real Estate,"If you're looking for the best Real Estate agent in Santa Clarita, look no further. Mike is professional, knowledgeable and so great to work with. One of the most hard working and honest people I have ever worked with, not to mention patient. Mike patiently worked with me on finding a new, bigger home to accommodate my needs. I must have asked him to see this house at least three times before finally choosing it. Mike was always ready and wiling to make an appointment to see the house. Once we opened escrow, Mike was on top of every detail and fought for me when necessary. I highly recommend Mike for all your Real Estate needs. He has helped me with sales, rentals and purchasing my wonderful new home."

Marie once again exceeded my expectations!! She recently helped my husband and I sell our duplex in a short amount of time, while getting us top dollar for it! This is the same property she helped me buy almost 8 years ago! When we decided to list our duplex, I knew there was no one else I could trust to get the job done. Marie is a go-getter, a very hard worker, and a pleasure to work with! She is not only our realtor, but she has become part of our family and I will continue to recommend her for as long as she’s in the business!"

Make Me Smart,"Anything Kai and Molly do is great and I can't get enough.  The podcasts are a great way to catch up in a limited time spam.  They are informative and delivered 'in style"".  My only thought would be to make them a moment longer and get into the 'deeper' part of each podcast.  They seem a little high level for us hoping to get smarter.  But still great.  Thanks for helping make me smarter (if that's possible)..."

Make Me Smart,"While I have heard the term ""block buster"" for many years, I never understood its origin. I appreciate the in-depth coverage of topics that is ""Make Me Smart"", but I also like the shorter Echo format for getting smarter.

Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,Ask Mastermind not Alexa
The Inclusive Leadership Coach,This is such an amazing briefing especially given our current political climate. I love Susan's stories and how they make me much more conscious of why I respond the way I do.

Design Driven Flash Briefing,"This is the best available briefing about product design. J Cornelius knows this field. This briefing is thoughtful, articulate, and actionable. It's similar to the Design Driven podcast from Nine Labs but is carefully created for the Flash Briefing format.
A fantastic resource for anyone in UX or a product related field.
J uses themes to chunk the content. For a few days in a row, he focuses on one subject such as Human Centered Business or how to effectively perform a Brand Check-In. This makes it effective from a learning standpoint - chunking is how our brains retain information. <3 minutes a day is a magic number for this. High quality content here."
Jobs Search,This app would be great if they gave me pertinent and relevant information on jobs that I'm actually interested in but instead it was telling me about different job titles that I did not specify it was a little bit frustrating because Alexa didn't know how to return to the beginning

Store Card,Applied for the card and received a letter declining. Just last week I got the card in the mail and never activated it but they went into my Amazon acct and changed my payment method. Previous payments that should have went to my bank  which showed up as pending then disappeared. Would not have known about this if I didn't go in and registered my card and found a balance due on my card. Needless to say I removed the card from my account as a payment method.

NBC News Radio: Consumer Business,
Harvard Business Review: Management Tip,Tips chosen were juvenile. Better for someone in his or her first year in the workforce rather than anyone in management. Also the sound is adjusted to be much louder than other briefings. Annoying to have to turn it down every time.
30-Second Blog and Business Tip w/ Pete McPherson,Pete always has gold nuggets of knowledge to share that are both simple and actionable. Such a great resource!

The Motley Fool,"Yeah voice recognition is silly and and frustrating unable to tell you what's on your list just index raises and lowers is useless to me, let me know when you improve. Until then this is useless"
Exponea,"The integration with Alexa can do not so much with Exponea analytics, but still, it is able to get you the data needed in the quickest way you can imagine. The day we bought couple of echodots and integrated them with Exponea was the day when the work has stopped. We could not stop to define new analyses and dashboards to ask the Alexa to read it. Amazing experience."

Run Your Business: Systems & Automation for Online,
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,"This is an excellent skill, it never fails and works flawlessly! I would like to see the addition of asking Alexa to initiate a call and then add ""on speakerphone"" as the whole point is that the smart service is handsfree. Ok Google can do this.

Capital One,"We have an Echo Show and this is the only bank that I've found with an Alexa Skill that has visual in addition to audible interaction.

I'd love to see this skill updated with:

1) Use the account nicknames I set in my online profile. Right now is just says ""Checking ####"" or ""Savings ####"".  When you have more than one of an account type, it is impossible to know which account is which and using the online nicknames I have set would be great!

2) Ability to show/hide certain accounts (this goes for online as well as the Alexa skill). I have an old long-closed credit card that is no use for me to see/hear. Even worse, this account is listed first by Alexa and is just an absolute waste of time to hear it go over the balance, last payment and open to buy for a closed account.

Keep up the great work! I opened up another account specifically because of this skill!!"
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,Developer has removed all references to Mastermind for Alexa from their website. Stop trying to make it work - it will never work again (app has been missing from the app store for months.)
Make Me Smart,"I like this new way to consume MMS content! It is intuitive to get the latest topic. I wish is were easier to navigate the backlog (instead of 3 at a time). Maybe say something like ""Alexa, does Make Me Smart know anything about X"" or ""Alexa, what does Make Me Smart know about"" where the app would return a list of keywords where I could reply ""Alexa, have Make Me Smart tell me about X"""
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,Good to use at work
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,"This used to be a must have skill that allowed you to interface with your Android phone through Alexa. I would have given it 6 stars if I could a year or so ago. Now its sadly a has been with only 1 star for old time sake. You could ask for your txt messages, check battery level, locate your phone etc. Now because Google wouldn't grant Convessa certain permissions the company made their app all about software developers and is now pretty much useless for 99% of users. Too bad."

Deputy,
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,Have not yet tried it but I'm very excited at the prospect of contacting my family and friends using Alexa.
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,I like this app because it allows Alexa to communicate with your phone and do several things such as get notifications change phone settings and text or call someone on your cell phone. You can check your battery level and when you ask it to call someone on your phone it actually dialed the correct contact. I sometimes have a problem getting Alexa to recognize some of my contacts and this works a little better for me because someone always calls when I am busy it's works good as a caller ID when I'm not looking at my phone. Well I can ask Alexa what my battery level is and get an accurate reading which is a plus. I'm always getting a phone call when my hands are wet and this app works great I can see who is calling me and answer the phone without touching it just by using my Echo Dot. I always I get to turn my phone on do not disturb when trying to sleep and this is a great way to do it without having to get up out the bed I just tell Alexa to turn my phone on do not disturb and it is done. I'm pretty sure there are some upgrade that can be done but I'm so far I'm liking this app

Run To Your Leadership Challenges!,"I recently rearranged my morning flash briefings to listen to Paul first.  As a military officer, I receive a whole lot of leadership advice and mentoring but rarely is it focused on how to tackle challenges that come up on a regular basis.  Learning and overcoming challenges is how we become better leaders.  Paul presents quick ideas for growth in a 3 min (or so) daily message.  I have gone to work and posed many of his questions to co-workers that have sparked entertaining and thoughtful discussion among other leaders and have used his commentary as a basis for professional development presentations.  Thanks Paul!"

Experian,Excellent.!!
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,"So far it works sporadically.  It rarely understands me the first time.  I'm going to assume that this is because it's in beta, so I'm going to keep trying until it's in full release.  I'm certainly not going to pay a monthly fee for something that doesn't work right."

Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,Great concept and so far does exactly what it says it does. Just starting to check out this app but the future looks good.
Capital One,"A slight bug...  when I request to make a payment of some amount of dollars &quot;and one cent,&quot; it doesn't map the &quot;and one cent&quot; to an amount, so it asks me to confirm payment of just the whole dollar amount. If I say &quot;and one cents,&quot; it maps that correctly to the additional $.01."
Stock Analysis by Zacks Investment Research Inc,Love it so far.  Would like to see my portfolio tracker connected.
Mastermind - AI Assistant for Software Dev Teams,"Mastermind is hands down the best app that Alexa has to offer, it does what it says it does!"

Rocket Mortgage,"A fast food approach to Mortgage Lending.

Remind yourself before deciding of the 2008 financial industry collapse in the hands of similar quick-close mortgage processing companies all around.  Firstly, DO your own home work.  Check with local lenders FIRST. Rocket in my opinion is only good for those applicants who would get a loan anywhere any time because the application is near perfect for a slam dunk close.  IF you are a Veteran or you expect that you would have to communicate with the Under-writers to do some thinking and heavy lifting, then Rocket Underwriters in my opinion will not do that for you.

They are predominantly a computer matrix driven paper-mill lender.  The ""Pre-approval letter"" is absolutely worthless!  Shocking by the way because Rocket will run a complete credit check, and virtually everything on your application and then some.

I strongly urge to ASK Rocket to write that loan after you have submitted everything you have on your computer...BEFORE making any offer.  Their loan officer(s) seem to be too quick to tell you to ""Make an offer ASAP, you are good as golden"".

ALL local lenders or companies that have been in business for a while offered me a much better VA home loan option.  MAINLY because a Mortgage Loan process requires an in-person communication with a Mortgage loan officer.  A $400K loan amount (in my case) needs to be thoroughly reviewed and written for a 30-year commitment.

In my humble experience, a GOOD mortgage loan officer and lender is some one who takes the time to FULLY assess your situation, screen all aspects of your application.  MOST IMPORTANTLY: they should use common sense and good judgement to approve your application, not a fast food window.

Rocket in my experience fails to take the time to actually ""process"" the application, rather runs it through computer written algorithms.  UNLESS you have a conventional and 10%-15% cash down.  Again, with that type of down, ANYONE can finance you a loan, because the loan automatically becomes a Low-Risk loan with down payment.

Shop around...don't rush, ask questions. It's your Home and a long commitment.

VERY IMPORTANT:  To all my Veteran family members, CALL the VA Home loan/mortgage advisers yourself.  ANY/EVERY VA loan policy/detail is write by the Dept. Of Veteran Affairs, NOT by financial lenders.  A private lender/Bank can only ""interpret"" how they see your VA benefits fit in to their profits.  They can find any quirk to deny you the loan, but a VA loan is frankly NOT a money maker for them.  It is however, the least historically defaulted home mortgage loan in America. VA should be the only source of your guidance.

Good luck to everyone."

Amex,"Enjoy this app, it's a easy app to get up and running.Made a payment, reviewed transactions and reviewed a 2nd card. Only thing that concerns me is making a payment, I think Alexa should review what card she is paying the amount and when. She does not review this prior to paying. You should be able to review and confirm payment before submitting. Any bill site has you review before submitting. I hope you can update this and adding another an extra command of switch between cards, etc. Nice app but room for  improvement."
